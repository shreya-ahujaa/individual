The first step is to convert the hexadecimal to a decimal value. You can do this by having the formula (16^0)(6) + (16^1)(5) = 86. On the ASCII table, the 86 corresponds with the letter V, making the answer to be V. I forgot how to convert the hexadecimal to a decimal while taking the test, so I was not able to do the question, but I understand it now and will be able to do it next time.

The option I chose, the IP address, comes with a user’s computer and is required for the user to send and receive information on the Internet. The IP address in itself does not contain any extra information about the user, so it would not be a security risk. The group of cookies would be the correct answer because it stroes the information of the user and the aggregation of information in browser cookies can be used by websites that the user visits to track the user and collect information about the user.

The answer I chose would still allow the code to run properly. Instead of x=2, y=3, z=1, the sequence of numbers that will cause the code to fail and output the wrong number would be x=3, y=2, z=1. This order will cause the wrong maximum to be displayed.

I chose the answer of 80 seconds but the right and correct answer should have 80 seconds. With parallel computing, the time it takes to complete the tasks can be combined, and so when combining the two largest amounts would be the 50 and 60 seconds. When running together, the process will finish in 60 seconds, and then in the 10 seconds after one of them is completed the other 30 seconds can start running, making it 20 seconds added to the 60 seconds, making it 80 seconds total time.

Using this solution, all four processes will finish executing in 95 seconds. Processes W and X will finish executing in 50 seconds on one processor, and processes Y and Z will finish executing in 95 seconds on the other processor. You have to add the processor times and find the combination of programs that will allow for the time to be the least as possible. In this case, the W and Z and the X and Y should be paired together as it would take about 75 seconds instead, making it much faster.

IPv6 addresses are longer than IPv4 addresses. The length of the address has no direct effect on routing speed. IPv6 allows for a greater number of IP addresses than IPv4 does, which allows more devices to be connected. This is something that I just have to know, but even though I didn't know it then, I know it now and will get the question correct the next time.

In the code segment that I chose, the robot ends in the lower-right corner of the grid, facing toward the top of the grid. In this code segment, count is 0 in the first iteration of the outer loop, so the robot rotates left, but does not move forward, causing it to end in the wrong place. The correct code segement causes the robot to move 1 square forward, then rotate left, then move 2 squares forward, then rotate left, then move 3 squares forward, then rotate left, then move 4 squares forward, then rotate left. The robot ends in the lower-right corner of the grid, facing toward the top of the grid, which is where it should be.

The answe I chose would not be correcrt because the information needed to be found cannot be determined with spreadsheets II and III because students with grade point averages of 3.5 or less cannot be identified. The desired information can be determined by using the student IDs in spreadsheet II to identify the students who play a sport. Once the students who play a sport are identified, the grade point averages of students who play sports in spreadsheet I can be compared to the grade point averages of all other students for the result that is needed.

The program segment that I chose was wrong because the number 20 is not displayed, even though it should be. The algorithm terminates immediately after x is assigned the value 20, and does not display 20. The correct code segment (D) 20 is displayed and x is incremented to 21. The value 21 is not displayed since it is a multiple of 3 and the algorithm terminates, allowing the code segment to work correctly.

The correct answer is that the mobile app release led to users tending to write shorter messages. This is correct as in the chart we can see that the average number of daily messages sent per user appears to increase after the mobile app was released. The answer I chose was wrong as it did not follow the trend and did the opposite.

The right answer in this situation would be to ‘Check if the time is during business hours. If it is, check if the gate sensor is activated. If it is, check if the gate is open. If it is not, turn on the motor.’ This answer is the correct one because the algorithm continues past the first check if the time is during business hours, the algorithm continues past the second check if the gate sensor is activated, and the algorithm continues past the third check if the gate is not open. Performing the checks in this order will ensure that the gate is opened only under the appropriate conditions. The one I chose can turn on the motor even when the gate is already open.

The correct answer is that "The number of registered users about doubled each year for years 1 to 5 and then increased at about a constant rate after that." This is shown in the graph of the data where from years 1 to 5, the number of registered users roughly doubled each year and from years 5 to 8, the number of registered users increased by about 100 million each year. The users do not grow at a constant rate every year.

The answer that I had chosen was incorrect because the geolocation data can be accessed by the Website, which can use this information to provide album reviews from nearby users. The correct answer should be that "The user will be in violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)." This is the situation that is LEAST likely to occur as a consequence because if the album was purchased and downloaded through a licensed music store, the user will not be in violation of the DMCA.

The Fourth procedure calculates a power of n(similar to the Square and Cube procedures), but it does not generalize this functionality to calculate any power of n. The correct answer would be D as it provides a code segement that is a generalization of this procedure is Power (n, m) which calculates n raised to the m power.

The program segement I chose incorrectly sets the value of bonus to the score when the score > 100. This is not what should have happened. The correct code segement sets bonus to score * 10 when score > 100, sets bonus to score when 100 ≥ score ≥ 50, and sets bonus to 0 when score < 50, which results in the correct outputs that the user had wanted.

The answer I chose is wrong as I did not follow the steps correctly and ended with the wrong values in the spots of first and second. The variable first is initially assigned the value 100 and the variable second is assigned the value 200. Temp is then assigned the value of first, which is 100. Next, second is assigned the value of temp, which is 100. After that first is assigned the value of second, which is 100. After execution, both first and second have the value 100.
