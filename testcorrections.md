The first step is to convert the hexadecimal to a decimal value. You can do this by having the formula (16^0)(6) + (16^1)(5) = 86. On the ASCII table, the 86 corresponds with the letter V, making the answer to be V. I forgot how to convert the hexadecimal to a decimal while taking the test, so I was not able to do the question, but I understand it now and will be able to do it next time.

The option I chose, the IP address, comes with a userâ€™s computer and is required for the user to send and receive information on the Internet. The IP address in itself does not contain any extra information about the user, so it would not be a security risk. The group of cookies would be the correct answer because it stroes the information of the user and the aggregation of information in browser cookies can be used by websites that the user visits to track the user and collect information about the user.

The answer I chose would still allow the code to run properly. Instead of x=2, y=3, z=1, the sequence of numbers that will cause the code to fail and output the wrong number would be x=3, y=2, z=1. This order will cause the wrong maximum to be displayed.

I chose the answer of 80 seconds but the right and correct answer should have 80 seconds. With parallel computing, the time it takes to complete the tasks can be combined, and so when combining the two largest amounts would be the 50 and 60 seconds. When running together, the process will finish in 60 seconds, and then in the 10 seconds after one of them is completed the other 30 seconds can start running, making it 20 seconds added to the 60 seconds, making it 80 seconds total time.
