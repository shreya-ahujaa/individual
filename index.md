## Shreya Ahuja - Individual Repository

On my Jekyll Pages, there will be the requirements for each week, which can be found on the navbar above. Each week has been divided into the notes from both the TPT and the Tech Talk, and there will also be the challenges or answers to the questions that we were required to do for credit!
