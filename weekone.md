## _**5.3 College Board Notes - Computing Bias**_

Essential Knowledge:

         ○ computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation
         ○ programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases
         ○ biases can be embedded at all levels of software development

Examples
Netflix
- Explicit Data

         ○ thumbs up/thumbs down
         ○ name, address, etc.
- Implicit Data

         ○ when you watch
         ○ what you binged
         ○ style of show frequently selected 
- Bias

         ○ netflix exclusives are featured ahead of most special
         ○ subscriptions

Biases
- all software can be biased (unintentional/intentional):

         ○ causal versus sweaty
         ○ youtube kids
         ○ facebook vs instagram vs snapchat vs tik tok
- questions to ask about bias

         ○ enhancing or intentionally excluding?
         ○ intentionally harmful/hateful?
         ○ receiving feedback from a wide variety of people?


## _**5.4 College Board Notes - Crowdsourcing**_

Essential Knowledge:

         ○ widespread access to information and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions, and dissemination of results
         ○ science has been affected by using distributed and “citizen science” to solve scientific problems 
         ○ citizen science is a scientific research conducted in a whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scientists, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices

Public Data Sets

- Kaggle

         ○ courses in visualization, machining learning, and more
         ○ competitions: cash prizes, swag, props
         ○ notebooks: code, data, notes
- Google Public Datasets

         ○ free for the first terabyte
         ○ all in one package that uses BigQuery 
- Data.gov

         ○ US government data
         ○ agriculture, energy, water, health
- Your Local Government

         ○ keeps them accountable


Innovations Made Possible by Crowdsourcing
- Spotify

         ○ collaborative playlists
         ○ algorithm
         ○ metadata write-in
- Crowdfunding

         ○ kickstarter
         ○ IndieGoGo
- Blockchain

         ○ cryptocurrency
         ○ other token → concert tickets
